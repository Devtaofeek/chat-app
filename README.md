# chat-app

A simple chat application built in Go.

This application explores the simplicity that Go provides for building applications that scale.
Even though it's a small learning experiment, it utilizes some powerful Go features like concurency,
and allowing users(clients) to join, send and read messages in different chat rooms and leave a room at anytime
they choose. These are done via different threads(goroutines).

This is still largely a WIP, but I'll keep updating it till I'm done

Built with :heart:
